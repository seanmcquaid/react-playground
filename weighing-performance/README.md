# Weighing Performance

This repo will serve as an area to experiment with some performance enhancement concepts in React. To keep it consistent, I am going to use the exact same tasks :

1. Data Fetching on load
2. Forms

I will do one version without any enhancements and then one with the enhancements identified for each concept to see how much is saved for each addition. Then I will try putting it all together and seeing if the React Dev Tools Profiler confirms what I believe
